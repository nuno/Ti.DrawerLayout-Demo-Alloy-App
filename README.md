# wintest.apk Demo App for [Ti.DrawerLayout](https://github.com/nuno/Ti.DrawerLayout-Demo-Alloy-App/wintest.apk)

This is a demo application for showing how to use [https://github.com/manumaticx/Ti.DrawerLayout](https://github.com/manumaticx/Ti.DrawerLayout)

It shows how to use the drawer for navigation. The left view of the drawer layout works as a menu that lets you switch between top-level views. Each content view is represented as an element in the menu.

Every content view is a separate controller which can have its own ActionBar setup and optionsMenu. We also want to achieve to add a consistent Overflow menu with standard action items like Help and Settings, according to the [Android Design Guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html) (Notice how the overflow menu stays visible as the Drawer layout expands while the contextual action items gets removed from the action bar).

Opening and closing the controllers for the content view is done by a global open method in `alloy.js`. It expects each controller to have an public `init` and `destroy` method. That way we can keep it clean and responsive.

### Limitations

I tried to make the drawer menu accessible from deeper-level views such as from a second window (e.g. detail window). You can't just add the global drawer reference to this. One workaround could be adding a new drawer instance with the same menu controller in it but this could become dangerous and complex. In a native app you'd use fragments. It's also possible to use activities but I need to think about how this could be accomplished from the module.
